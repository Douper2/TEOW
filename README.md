Just an **T**ext **E**ditor for **O**ld **W**indows

- [ ] Compiler/interpreter support for actual coding
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Remaking the UI to look like a frutiger aero app (adding frutiger aero icons etc.)
- [ ] Getting colors/other stuff from json or another file and putting that in the program
- [ ] CTRL + F to search for specific text/piece of code
- [x] Adding support for non-english languages (e.g. Romanian, Serbian, Hungarian, German, Spanish, etc.)
- [x] Opening files
- [x] App runs

## Problems with the app
- Big files load slowly
- You tell me
- Saving doesn't work (I have no clue why)
